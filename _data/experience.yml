  description: |
    I worked on software development using Ruby on Rails, ReactJS, PostgreSQL, among other technologies. I performed bug fixes, implemented new features and developed automated tests using RSpec. The work dynamics, based on methodologies, provided me with experience with Scrum, Kanban and OKR. In addition to the new features and bug fixes, I also developed some projects, for example a security system to avoid multiple requests on the server, which could indicate an eventual attempted invasion. This and other projects were really fun to be doing because I was able to learn several other more technical concepts of web development.
